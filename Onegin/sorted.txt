And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And thus the native hue of resolution
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action. – Soft you now!
But that the dread of something after death,
Be all my sins remember'd.
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
Than fly to others that we know not of?
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
The insolence of office and the spurns
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That makes calamity of so long life;
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
With this regard their currents turn awry,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
When he himself might his quietus make
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
